# ESP32-WebSocket-Series
In this series, I use websocket to communicate between client and server.Websocket ,in my opinion, is MUCH BETTER that HTTPT protocol, because with WS ,we can make real-time communication, update to all clients, transfer much more data stream as well as protect your data between connection ,all of this in real life!
